# YouTube-Analysis

1. Aims, objectives and background
1.1. Introduction

YouTube was launched on February 14, 2005. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website after Google Search, it processes more than 3 billion searches per month. YouTube provides a platform for a diverse range of content, including music videos, tutorials, vlogs, documentaries, and much more. YouTube offers a wealth of data for analysis.

As a new data analyst i spend good amount of my time learning and finding solutions on YouTube. In this project i will analyse the channels that contributed immensely to my data analysis skills. I will compare and analyse the video metrics, channels performance and audience of the channels. In this project I will first explore the statistics of my favourite favourite channels and then I will pick one channel and do an in depth analysis.

1.2. Aims and objectives

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:
Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.

Across all the channels I will take into consideration;
which channel has the most views?
which channel has the most video?
which channel has the most subscribers?

i will analyze video data of one channel to identify trends and what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:
Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
Does title length matter for views?
Does video description length matter for views?
Does the number of videos posted daily influence daily views?
Does the number of videos posted monthly have correlation with monthly views?
Top 10 most viewed videos?
which month the channel upload more videos?
which day the channel upload more videos?

1.3. Steps of the project
Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for the 7 channels (this includes several small steps:create a developer key, request data and transform the responses into a usable data format)
Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis
Exploratory data analysis
